## Introduction

An introduction to yet another 'script' to add to your arsenal.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- Explain the relationship between ES6 and TypeScript
- Understand what type definitions are and why they are necessary
- Read and write TypeScript code that employs typing
- Use classes and interfaces to make their code more readable and maintainable

## Fundamentals

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an open-sourced programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that **any existing valid JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.** TypeScript transcompiles to JavaScript, so **it can be run in both browsers and serverside.**

### "TS as a superset of JS"

This phrase is just a fancy way to say that TypeScript includes all of the types, semantics and functionality of JavaScript while adding a few bells and whistles of its own.

So why bother with TypeScript? It turns out that some of those extra bells and whistles are extremely useful! A few new features TypeScript brings to the table are:

- Optional Typing
- Interfaces
- Decorators

All three of these features will be important to us as we dive into Angular 2, so let's learn them!
